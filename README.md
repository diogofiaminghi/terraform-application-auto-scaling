## Description

This project provisions a VPC and an EC2 instance on AWS through Terraform. In this project, the terraform.tfstate file is stored remotely in an S3 bucket. In addition, we have the creation of a Subnet, AWS Internet Gateway, Route Table and AWS Security Group. Finally, an EC2 instance is created within the Subnet. All resources will be created in the us-east-1 region.
- VPC
- Internet Gateway (IG) 
- Subnets
- Route Tables
- Security Groups
- Load Balancer
- Auto Scaling Group
- CloudWatch
- RDS

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Terraform] (https://www.terraform.io/) and [Git] (https://git-scm.com).
You will need to have a [AWS Account] (https://aws.amazon.com/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/).

---

## How it works

1 - Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:diogofiaminghi/terraform-project-01.git
```

2 - Create an S3 bucket on AWS manually.

3 - Open de Project Folder in VSCode

4 - Edit the main.tf file. On line 13, paste the name of your S3 bucket.

```bash
bucket = "your-S3-bucket-name-here"
```

5 - Open a new bash terminal in VSCode. Create an SSH key pair named 'aws-key'.

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

6 - You must now configure your AWS Access Keys using the bash terminal.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
```bash
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

7 - Terraform Commands in Project Folder
```bash
terraform init
```

```bash
terraform fmt
```

```bash
terraform validate
```

```bash
terraform plan -out=plan.out
```

```bash
terraform apply plan.out
```

8 - Now, to prove that everything worked, get the 'vm_ip' in 'output' and let's connect via ssh to the newly created instance.

```bash
ssh -i aws-key ubuntu@the-public-ip-here
```
```bash
exit
```

9 - Do not forget to destroy the provisioned structure otherwise you will be able to receive invoices.
```bash
terraform destroy
```
